    I am a passionate front-end developer, based in Colima,
    father, husband and technology lover.
    <br /><br />

    My skills are based around front end technologies like
    Javascript, HTML5, CSS3. I enjoy working in projects
    where my experience in cross-browser adjustments,
    responsive design for mobile and web, and 3D objects is
    required. What I enjoy the most is creating a great UX
    and impacting the end user with my work.
    <br /><br />

    As far as back-end and programming languages, and I am
    in the process of learning Ruby. From this language,
    I have also taken a deep look at Ruby on Rails and
    Sinatra. Which has given me the chance to learn to
    differentiate when a certain solution might be too much,
    or too little to use as a solution.
    <br /><br />

    My hobbies are the web, music and general art.
