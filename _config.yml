description: >
  I am a front-end developer, based in Colima, MÃ©xico, father,
  husband and technology lover.
  <br><br>
  My skills are based around front end technologies like
  JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. I enjoy working in projects where
  my experience in cross-browser adjustments, responsive design
  for mobile and web is required. What I enjoy the most is
  creating a great UX and impacting the end user with my work.
  <br><br>
  Currently I combine back-end and front-end to create interesting
  mobile and web applications on frameworks like NodeJS,
  AngularJS and Ionic
  <br><br>
  My hobbies are the web, music and general art.
