    <description>I am a front-end developer, based in Colima, MÃ©xico, father, husband and technology lover. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My skills are based around front end technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. I enjoy working in projects where my experience in cross-browser adjustments, responsive design for mobile and web is required. What I enjoy the most is creating a great UX and impacting the end user with my work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Currently I combine back-end and front-end to create interesting mobile and web applications on frameworks like NodeJS, AngularJS and Ionic &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My hobbies are the web, music and general art.
